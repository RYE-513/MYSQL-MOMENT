-- AND, OR, NOT OPERATORS

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birth_date >= '1990-01-01' AND points > 1000

-- both these conditions are true

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birth_date >= '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000

-- the first condition is false and the one is true

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birth_date >= '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000
	AND state = 'VA'

-- the first logical operator will be first to execute
-- CLARITY

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birth_date >= '1990-01-01' OR 
	(points > 1000 AND state = 'VA')

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE NOT (birth_date >= '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000) is just like WHERE birth_date <= '1990-01-01' AND points <= 1000

-- both these conditions are false
